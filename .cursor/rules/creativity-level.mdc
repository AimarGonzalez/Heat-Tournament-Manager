## No Inventions
Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## Ask if needed
If you are tempted to do more than asked, ask me first weather I like the suggestion, and I'll tell you can go ahead or not.

## Don't restart the server
Do not kill and restart the server after every change please.
Ask me for it if its needed.
